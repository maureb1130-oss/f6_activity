Version control is important in collaborative projects because it allows multiple people to work on the same files without accidentally overwriting each other’s changes. It keeps a complete history of edits, making it easy to track who changed what and when. If mistakes happen, version control lets teams revert to earlier versions safely. Overall, it ensures smoother collaboration, better organization, and fewer errors in shared work.

Git offers automated tracking of changes, making it far more reliable than manually saving multiple file versions. It also supports branching and merging, allowing developers to experiment without risking the main project. Overall, Git reduces errors and makes collaboration smoother and more organized.
