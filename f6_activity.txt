Version control is important in collaborative projects because it allows multiple people to work on the same files without accidentally overwriting each other’s changes. It keeps a complete history of edits, making it easy to track who changed what and when. If mistakes happen, version control lets teams revert to earlier versions safely. Overall, it ensures smoother collaboration, better organization, and fewer errors in shared work.
